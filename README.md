## FAQ

**Q: When is this gonna be done?**

A: PLEASE, and we ask nicely, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON'T ASK THIS, CODE TAKES A WHILE TO MAKE, AND THERE'S ONLY ONE EXPERIENCED-ish LUA CODER IN THE TEAM. DO NOT PRESSURE US.

**Q: Can we use this to make mods?**

A(Stilic(Good Guy)): As of now, not yet. But when it's done, you're free to do so!
A(Some.): Yeah, sure.

**Q: Will there be a chart editor?**

A(Some.): Listen here, I can't just code an entire project that took a year and code in in LUA !!!
A(Stilic(Good Guy)): For now, no. Just use something like Psych Engine or Kade Engine to chart. Hell, maybe even ArrowVortex.
