# ⚠️!! FAQ !!⚠️
### Q: When is this gonna be done?
### **_A: PLEASE, and we ask nicely, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON'T ASK THIS, CODE TAKES A WHILE TO MAKE, AND THERE'S ONLY ONE EXPERIENCED-ish LUA CODER IN THE TEAM. DO NOT PRESSURE US._**

Q: Can we use this to make mods?

A: As of now, not yet. But when it's done, you're free to do so!

Q: Will there be a chart editor?

A: No. If i added, it would be shit, just use something like psych or kade to chart.
Hell, maybe even ArrowVortex
